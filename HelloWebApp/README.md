Web app I created during one of my programming courses and developed after that.

Simple app to get in touch with more advanced features commonly used in programmming. Firstly written without Spring, then rewritten with it. App will greet you in language chosen from db and then allow you to arrange your duties in on of three categories divided by importance(every dutie stored in db). 

/Tech:
- Spring
- Maven
- Tomcat(Jetty earlier)
- H2 database
- Flyway
