Web app I created during one of my internet programming courses and developed after that.

Simple app to get in touch with more advanced features commonly used in programmming. Firstly written without Spring, then rewritten with it.

/Tech:
- Spring
- Maven
- Tomcat(Jetty earlier)
- H2 database
- Flyway
